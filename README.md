- **Web-first** - No installation, works in any modern browser
- **Beautiful** - Light/dark/high-contrast themes, colorblind-safe palettes
- **Species-agnostic** - 27+ built-in assemblies, works with any genome
- **Private** - All data stays in your browser

## Supported File Formats

### Local Files (drag & drop)

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| BED | Interval features (BED3-BED12) |
| GFF3 | Gene annotations with hierarchies |
| bedGraph | Signal/coverage data |
| VCF | Variant calls |
| BigBed (.bb) | Indexed BED (requires no index file) |
| BigWig (.bw) | Indexed signal (requires no index file) |
| BAM | Alignments (requires .bai index) |
| CRAM | Alignments with reference (requires .crai index) |
| VCF.gz | Tabix-indexed variants (requires .tbi index) |
| GFF.gz | Tabix-indexed annotations (requires .tbi index) |
| BED.gz | Tabix-indexed intervals (requires .tbi index) |

### Remote URLs (paste in sidebar)

All indexed formats above can also be loaded from URLs. The index file must be at the same URL path (e.g., `file.bam` + `file.bam.bai`).

## Quick Start

1. Open [GBetter](https://teammaclean.github.io/gbetter/) in your browser
2. Gene tracks load automatically for the selected assembly
3. Add your own data:
   - **Local files**: Drag & drop or use File tab in sidebar
   - **Remote URLs**: Paste BigBed/BigWig/BAM URLs in URL tab
4. Navigate using the search bar:
   - Gene name: `TP53`
   - Coordinates: `chr17:7668421-7687490`
   - Commands: `zoom in`, `pan left 10kb`
5. Customize appearance in Settings (gear icon):
   - Theme: Light / Dark / High-Contrast
   - Palette: Set2 / Dark2 / Paired (all colorblind-safe)

## Built-in Assemblies

GBetter includes 27+ genome assemblies with automatic gene/transcript tracks:

| Category | Assemblies |
|----------|------------|
| **Human** | GRCh38 (hg38), GRCh37 (hg19), T2T-CHM13 |
| **Mouse** | mm39, mm10 |
| **Model Organisms** | Zebrafish (danRer11), Fly (dm6), Worm (ce11), Yeast (sacCer3) |
| **Plants** | Arabidopsis (TAIR10), Rice (IRGSP-1.0), Maize (Zm-B73), Wheat, Barley |
| **Fungi** | S. pombe, Botrytis, Magnaporthe, Puccinia, Zymoseptoria |
| **Microbes** | E. coli K-12, SARS-CoV-2 |

Reference sequences (2bit) are available for all assemblies, enabling nucleotide display at high zoom.

---

## Themes & Accessibility

GBetter is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Three themes**: Light (default, print-ready), Dark, High-Contrast
- **Colorblind-safe palettes**: Set2, Dark2, Paired (all from ColorBrewer)
- **Geometric strand indication**: Chevrons show direction, not colors
- **High contrast mode**: Maximum contrast for low-vision users

All themes and palettes are in Settings > Display tab.

## Search Bar vs GQL Console

GBetter has two query interfaces:

### Search Bar (Header)

The search bar in the header is for quick navigation:

| Input | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Gene name | `TP53`, `BRCA1` |
| Coordinates | `chr17:7668421-7687490` |
| Commands | `zoom in`, `pan left 10kb`, `filter type=exon` |

Works instantly, no AI required. Great for everyday navigation.

### GQL Console (Bottom Panel)

For advanced queries, open the GQL Console (`Cmd+\`` or click the tab at the bottom):

- **Natural language input** - "show me genes with high-impact variants" (with [AI configured](docs/AI-SETUP.md))
- **Editable GQL** - Review and modify translated queries before execution
- **Clickable results** - Navigate to any result with one click
- **Query history** - Replay previous queries
- **Save & share** - Export queries as `.gql` files or share via URL

The Console translates natural language to GQL, giving you reproducible commands you can save, share, and re-run.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Use the Live Version (Recommended)

Just visit **https://teammaclean.github.io/gbetter/** - nothing to install.

Your data never leaves your browser. Files are parsed locally using JavaScript.

### Option 2: Deploy Your Own Instance

Fork GBetter to your GitHub account and deploy via GitHub Pages:

1. **Fork the repository**

   Click the "Fork" button at https://github.com/TeamMacLean/gbetter

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**

   In your forked repo, go to **Settings > Pages**:
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**
   - Click Save

3. **Wait for deployment**

   The deploy workflow runs automatically. Your instance will be live at:
   ```
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/gbetter/
   ```

4. **Keep it updated**

   Sync your fork periodically to get new features:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   git push
   ```

### Option 3: Run Locally

For development or offline use:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TeamMacLean/gbetter.git
cd gbetter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Option 4: Self-Host on Your Server

Build and deploy to any static hosting:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Output is in the 'build' directory
# Deploy to nginx, Apache, S3, Netlify, etc.
```

Note: Update `svelte.config.js` to change the base path if not hosting at root.

## GQL - GBetter Query Language

GBetter includes a simple, reproducible query language for genome browser operations. Natural language queries are automatically translated to GQL for reproducibility.

### Basic Commands

```
navigate chr17:7668421-7687490   # Go to coordinates
search gene TP53                  # Find and navigate to a gene
zoom in                          # Zoom in 2x
zoom out                         # Zoom out 2x
pan left 10kb                    # Move left 10,000 bp
filter type=exon                 # Highlight exons, dim other features
highlight chr17:7670000-7675000  # Highlight a region
clear filters                    # Remove all filters
```

### Advanced Queries (SELECT)

```
SELECT GENES IN VIEW
SELECT VARIANTS FROM my-vcf WHERE significance = 'pathogenic'
SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 10
COUNT VARIANTS WITHIN TP53
```

See the [GQL Manual](docs/GQL-MANUAL.md) for complete documentation, or [GQL Examples](docs/GQL-EXAMPLES.md) for practical use cases.

## AI Setup

GBetter's AI features translate natural language into reproducible GQL commands. Choose your preferred AI backend:

| Provider | Privacy | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Ollama** (Local) | Complete - runs on your machine | Free |
| **Anthropic** (Claude) | Query text sent to API | Pay-per-use |
| **OpenAI** (GPT) | Query text sent to API | Pay-per-use |

**Your genomic data files are never sent to external services** - only your query text and track metadata.

See the [AI Setup Guide](docs/AI-SETUP.md) for detailed installation and configuration instructions.

## Privacy & Security

**Your genomic data never leaves your browser** unless you explicitly choose to use cloud AI features.

- All file parsing happens client-side in JavaScript
- No server, no database, no tracking
- AI queries send only your search text (not your data)
- Optional local LLM support (Ollama) for complete privacy
- Clear indicators when data would be sent externally

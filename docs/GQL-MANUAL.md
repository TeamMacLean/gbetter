# GQL Manual - GBetter Query Language

GQL (GBetter Query Language) is a simple, reproducible query language for genome browser operations. When you type natural language into the search bar, GBetter translates it to GQL, ensuring your queries are always reproducible and shareable.

## Navigation Commands

Navigate directly to genomic coordinates.

### Syntax

```
navigate <coordinates>
goto <coordinates>
go <coordinates>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Format |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| coordinates | Genomic location | `chr:start-end` |

### Examples

```
navigate chr17:7668421-7687490
goto chr1:1000000-2000000
go chrX:15000000-16000000
```

### Notes

- Coordinates are 1-based (genomics convention)
- Chromosome names are case-insensitive (`chr17` = `Chr17` = `CHR17`)
- Commas in numbers are stripped (`chr1:1,000,000-2,000,000` works)

---

pan r               # Move right 10 kb (default)
```

---

## Filter Commands

Filter features by attributes. Non-matching features are dimmed (shown at 25% opacity).

### Syntax

```
filter <field>=<value> [<field>=<value> ...]
```

### Common Fields

| Field | Description | Example Values |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| type | Feature type | exon, CDS, gene, mRNA, UTR |
| strand | DNA strand | +, - |
| name | Feature name | Gene name, transcript ID |

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| = | Equals | `type=exon` |
| != | Not equals | `type!=intron` |
| > | Greater than | `score>100` |
| < | Less than | `score<50` |
| >= | Greater or equal | `score>=75` |
| <= | Less or equal | `length<=1000` |
| ~ | Matches regex | `name~BRCA*` |
| * | Contains | `name*kinase` |

### Examples

```
filter type=exon                    # Show only exons
filter type=CDS                     # Show only coding sequences
filter strand=+                     # Show plus strand features
filter strand=-                     # Show minus strand features
filter type=exon strand=+           # Combine filters (AND)
filter score>100                    # Features with score > 100
```

### Notes

- Filtering is case-insensitive (`type=exon` matches `Exon`, `EXON`)
- Multiple filters use AND logic
- Use `clear filters` to remove all filters

---

## Highlight Commands

Add a visual highlight to a genomic region.

### Syntax

```
highlight <coordinates>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Format |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| coordinates | Region to highlight | `chr:start-end` |

### Examples

```
highlight chr17:7670000-7675000
highlight chr1:1000000-1500000
```

### Notes

- Highlights are drawn as semi-transparent overlays
- Multiple highlights can be active simultaneously
- Highlighting a region also navigates to show it
- Use `clear highlights` to remove all highlights

---

## Clear Commands

Remove active filters and/or highlights.

### Syntax

```
clear [target]
```

### Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| filters | Remove all active filters |
| highlights | Remove all highlights |
| all | Remove both filters and highlights |
| (none) | Same as `all` |

### Examples

```
clear filters       # Remove filters only
clear highlights    # Remove highlights only
clear all           # Remove everything
clear               # Remove everything
```

---

## List Commands

Query loaded data and display results.

### Syntax

```
list <what> [modifiers]
find <what> [modifiers]
show <what> [modifiers]
```

### What to List

| What | Description |
|------|-------------|
| genes | All genes (from loaded tracks or built-in index) |
| variants | All variants from loaded VCF tracks |
| genes with variants | Genes overlapping variant positions |
| variants in GENE | Variants within a specific gene |
| pathogenic variants | Variants marked as pathogenic |

### Examples

```
list genes                    # All known genes
list variants                 # All loaded variants
list genes with variants      # Genes containing variants
list variants in TP53         # Variants within TP53
list pathogenic variants      # Clinically significant variants
find genes                    # Same as list
show variants                 # Same as list
```

---

## SELECT Queries

SQL-like queries for complex data analysis.

### Syntax

```
SELECT <what> [FROM <track>] [INTERSECT <track>] [WITHIN <region>] [WHERE <conditions>] [IN <scope>] [ORDER BY <field> [ASC|DESC]] [LIMIT <n>]
```

### What to Select

| What | Description |
|------|-------------|
| GENES | Gene features |
| VARIANTS | Variant features |
| FEATURES | All features |
| * or ALL | Everything |

### Clauses

#### FROM

Specify a source track by name.

```
SELECT GENES FROM my-annotations
SELECT VARIANTS FROM sample.vcf
```

#### INTERSECT

Find features overlapping another track.

```
SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants
SELECT FEATURES FROM peaks INTERSECT promoters
```

#### WITHIN

Find features within a gene or region.

```
SELECT VARIANTS WITHIN TP53
SELECT FEATURES WITHIN chr17:7000000-8000000
```

#### WHERE

Filter by field values.

```
SELECT VARIANTS WHERE significance = 'pathogenic'
SELECT GENES WHERE strand = '+' AND length > 10000
```

Supported operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `CONTAINS`, `MATCHES`

#### IN

Limit scope to a region.

```
SELECT GENES IN VIEW                    # Current viewport
SELECT VARIANTS IN CHROMOSOME           # Current chromosome
SELECT FEATURES IN chr17                # Specific chromosome
SELECT GENES IN chr17:7000000-8000000   # Specific region
```

#### ORDER BY

Sort results.

```
SELECT GENES ORDER BY name ASC
SELECT GENES ORDER BY length DESC
SELECT GENES ORDER BY (end - start) DESC    # Same as length
```

#### LIMIT

Restrict number of results.

```
SELECT GENES LIMIT 10
SELECT GENES ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 5
```

### Complete Examples

```
# Top 10 longest genes in view
SELECT GENES IN VIEW ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 10

# Pathogenic variants in BRCA1
SELECT VARIANTS WITHIN BRCA1 WHERE significance = 'pathogenic'

# Genes that have variants, sorted by name
SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants ORDER BY name ASC

# All features from a specific track in current view
SELECT * FROM my-track IN VIEW

# Count CDS features on the plus strand
SELECT FEATURES WHERE type = 'CDS' AND strand = '+'
```

---

## COUNT Queries

Count features without listing them.

### Syntax

Same as SELECT, but returns only the count.

```
COUNT <what> [clauses...]
```

### Examples

```
COUNT GENES                           # Total genes
COUNT VARIANTS IN VIEW                # Variants in viewport
COUNT GENES INTERSECT variants        # Genes with variants
COUNT FEATURES WHERE type = 'exon'    # Number of exons
```

## Coordinate Formats

GBetter accepts various coordinate formats:

| Format | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Standard | chr17:7668421-7687490 | Most common |
| With commas | chr17:7,668,421-7,687,490 | For readability |
| Short form | chr17:7668421 | Single position (1bp range) |
| Spaces | chr17: 7668421 - 7687490 | Spaces are stripped |

All coordinates are **1-based, inclusive** following genomics convention.

---

## Natural Language Translation

GBetter automatically translates natural language to GQL:

| Natural Language | GQL Translation |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "go to TP53" | `search gene TP53` |
| "show chr17:7668421-7687490" | `navigate chr17:7668421-7687490` |
| "zoom in" | `zoom in` |
| "move left" | `pan left 10kb` |
| "show only exons" | `filter type=exon` |
| "show plus strand" | `filter strand=+` |
| "what genes have variants" | `list genes with variants` |
| "variants in BRCA1" | `list variants in BRCA1` |
| "highlight TP53" | `highlight chr17:7668421-7687490` |
| "clear everything" | `clear all` |

### Tips

- Be specific: "filter to exons" is clearer than "show exons"
- Gene names work directly: typing "TP53" navigates there
- Coordinates are auto-detected and converted to navigate commands

---

## Error Handling

If a query fails, GBetter provides helpful error messages:

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Invalid coordinates" | Malformed chr:start-end | Check coordinate format |
| "Gene not found" | Unknown gene name | Verify spelling, try search |
| "Track not found" | FROM references missing track | Load the track first |
| "No filter criteria" | Empty filter command | Add field=value pairs |
| "Unknown command" | Unrecognized GQL | Check command spelling |

# Gene Track Hosting

GBetter automatically loads gene annotations for supported genomes. This document explains how gene tracks work and how to add support for new genomes.

## How It Works

When you select a genome assembly, GBetter checks if there's a known gene annotation source for that genome. If found, it loads genes on-demand as you navigate, fetching only the data needed for the current viewport via HTTP Range requests.

## Understanding the Tracks

GBetter can display two types of annotation tracks: **Genes** and **Transcripts**. Not all assemblies have both.

### Genes Track

The Genes track shows **gene-level** annotations:

- **One feature per gene** (e.g., TP53, BRCA1, AT1G01010)
- **Simple rectangle** spanning the full gene extent
- **No internal structure** - just the gene boundaries
- **Best for**: Getting an overview, seeing gene density, identifying gene locations

```
Gene: TP53
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
        (single continuous feature)
```

### Transcripts Track

The Transcripts track shows **transcript-level** annotations:

- **One feature per transcript isoform** (e.g., ENST00000413465.6)
- **Compound structure** with exon blocks connected by intron lines
- **Shows splicing patterns** - thick boxes for exons, thin lines for introns
- **Multiple isoforms per gene** due to alternative splicing
- **Best for**: Detailed gene structure, understanding splicing, isoform analysis

```
Transcript: ENST00000413465.6 (TP53)

 (exons connected by intron lines)
```

### Which Assemblies Have Which Tracks?

| Assembly | Genes | Transcripts | Why |
|----------|:-----:|:-----------:|-----|
| **Human** (GRCh38, hg38, hg19) | ❌ | ✅ | UCSC only provides transcript-level data |
| **Mouse** (mm39, mm10) | ❌ | ✅ | UCSC only provides transcript-level data |
| **Arabidopsis** (TAIR10) | ✅ | ✅ | We host both gene and transcript files |
| **Rice** (IRGSP-1.0) | ✅ | ✅ | We host both gene and transcript files |
| **S. pombe** | ✅ | ✅ | We host both gene and transcript files |
| **E. coli K-12** | ✅ | ❌ | Bacteria don't have alternative splicing |
| **SARS-CoV-2** | ✅ | ❌ | Viruses don't have alternative splicing |

**Note**: For human/mouse genomes, you only see the Transcripts track because UCSC's knownGene.bb file contains transcript models with exon structure, not collapsed gene features. The gene symbol (like "TP53") is metadata on each transcript, not a separate feature.

## Gene Track Sources

| Source | Genomes | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **UCSC** | Human (hg38, hg19), Mouse (mm39, mm10), T2T-CHM13 | Official UCSC Known Genes / GENCODE |
| **GenArk** | Zebrafish, Fly, Worm, Yeast, Rat, Chicken | NCBI RefSeq annotations via UCSC GenArk hubs |
| **Self-hosted** | Arabidopsis, Rice, S. pombe, Botrytis, Magnaporthe, E. coli, SARS-CoV-2 | Converted from Ensembl/NCBI GFF3 |

## Adding New Genomes

If you want to add gene track support for a genome not listed above:

### Option 1: Find an existing BigBed file

Check if UCSC or GenArk already has a BigBed file:
- UCSC gbdb: `https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/{assembly}/`
- GenArk hubs: `https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/hubs/`

If found, add the URL to `src/lib/services/bigbed.ts` in the `GENE_BIGBED_URLS` object.

### Option 2: Convert from GFF3

For genomes with GFF3 annotations (Ensembl, NCBI, etc.), use our conversion pipeline:

1. **Add genome config** to `scripts/gene-tracks/genomes.json`
2. **Run conversion**: `python scripts/gene-tracks/convert_gffutils.py <genome_id>`
3. **Upload to R2**: `./scripts/gene-tracks/upload-r2.sh <genome_id>`
4. **Add URL** to `src/lib/services/bigbed.ts`

See [`scripts/gene-tracks/README.md`](../scripts/gene-tracks/README.md) for complete setup instructions including Cloudflare R2 configuration.

## Chromosome Name Mapping

Different data sources use different chromosome naming conventions:
- **UCSC**: `chr1`, `chr2`, `chrX`
- **Ensembl**: `1`, `2`, `X`
- **NCBI**: `NC_000001.11`, `NC_000002.12`

GBetter automatically maps between conventions. If your BigBed file uses non-standard names, add a mapping in `GENE_BIGBED_CHROMOSOME_MAP` in `src/lib/services/bigbed.ts`.

## Technical Details

- **Format**: BigBed (indexed binary BED)
- **Library**: `@gmod/bbi` for parsing
- **Transport**: HTTP Range requests (no full download)
- **Caching**: 5-minute in-memory cache per region

## File Locations

- `src/lib/services/bigbed.ts` - BigBed service, URL mappings
- `src/lib/stores/remoteTracks.svelte.ts` - Track state management
- `scripts/gene-tracks/` - GFF3 → BigBed conversion pipeline

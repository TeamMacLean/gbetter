## Navigation

### Go to a specific region

```
navigate chr17:7668421-7687490
```

Or use the shorthand:

```
goto chr17:7668421-7687490
go chr17:7668421-7687490
```

### Navigate to a gene

```
search gene TP53
```

Just the gene name also works:

```
TP53
```

### Move around the current view

```
# Zoom controls
zoom in              # 2x closer
zoom out             # 2x farther
zoom 4x              # 4x farther
zoom 0.5x            # 2x closer (same as zoom in)

# Pan controls
pan left 10kb        # Move left 10,000 bp
pan right 50000      # Move right 50,000 bp
pan left 1mb         # Move left 1 megabase
```

## Gene Exploration

### Find a cancer-related gene

```
search gene BRCA1
```

### View the TP53 tumor suppressor

```
navigate chr17:7668421-7687490
```

### See coding sequences only

```
filter type=CDS
```

### Show exon structure

```
filter type=exon
```

### View plus strand genes

```
filter strand=+
```

### Combine filters

```
filter type=exon strand=+
```

### Clear filters to see everything

```
clear filters
```

---

## Variant Analysis

### List all loaded variants

```
list variants
```

### Find variants in a specific gene

```
list variants in TP53
list variants in BRCA1
list variants in EGFR
```

### Find genes that contain variants

```
list genes with variants
```

### Find pathogenic variants

```
list pathogenic variants
```

### Count variants in view

```
COUNT VARIANTS IN VIEW
```

### Query variants with specific properties

```
SELECT VARIANTS WHERE significance = 'pathogenic'
SELECT VARIANTS WHERE ref = 'A' AND alt = 'G'
```

---

## Feature Filtering

### Show only exons

```
filter type=exon
```
*Natural language: "show only exons", "filter to exons"*

### Show only coding sequences (CDS)

```
filter type=CDS
```

### Show features on plus strand

```
filter strand=+
```
*Natural language: "show plus strand", "filter to forward strand"*

### Show features on minus strand

```
filter strand=-
```
*Natural language: "show minus strand", "filter to reverse strand"*

### Filter by score (BED files)

```
filter score>100
filter score>=75
```

### Multiple conditions

```
filter type=exon strand=+
filter type=CDS score>50
```

### Reset all filters

```
clear filters
```
*Natural language: "clear filters", "remove filters", "reset"*

---

## Region Highlighting

### Highlight a specific region

```
highlight chr17:7670000-7675000
```

### Highlight multiple regions

```
highlight chr17:7668000-7670000
highlight chr17:7680000-7687000
```

### Highlight a gene region

Natural language translates gene names to coordinates:

*"highlight TP53"* becomes:

```
highlight chr17:7668421-7687490
```

### Clear all highlights

```
clear highlights
```

### Clear everything (filters + highlights)

```
clear all
```

---

## Data Queries

### List all genes

```
list genes
```
*Natural language: "show genes", "what genes are there"*

### List genes in current view

```
SELECT GENES IN VIEW
```

### List genes on current chromosome

```
SELECT GENES IN CHROMOSOME
```

### List all variants

```
list variants
```

### Count features

```
COUNT GENES
COUNT VARIANTS
COUNT VARIANTS IN VIEW
COUNT GENES IN chr17
```

---

## Complex Analysis

### Find the 10 longest genes

```
SELECT GENES ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 10
```

### Find genes overlapping variants

```
SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants
```

### Find variants within TP53

```
SELECT VARIANTS WITHIN TP53
```

### Find pathogenic variants in cancer genes

```
SELECT VARIANTS WITHIN BRCA1 WHERE significance = 'pathogenic'
SELECT VARIANTS WITHIN TP53 WHERE significance = 'pathogenic'
```

### Count variants per gene

```
SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants ORDER BY name ASC
```
*Results include variant overlap count in details*

### Query a specific track

```
SELECT * FROM my-annotations IN VIEW
SELECT GENES FROM reference-genes WHERE strand = '+'
SELECT FEATURES FROM peaks WHERE score > 100
```

### Combine track intersection with filtering

```
SELECT GENES FROM annotations INTERSECT variants WHERE strand = '+' ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 5
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Check a gene of interest

You want to examine TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor:

```
search gene TP53        # Navigate to the gene
filter type=exon        # Focus on exon structure
zoom in                 # Get a closer look
clear filters           # See full annotation
```

### Scenario 2: Find variants in candidate genes

You have a VCF loaded and want to check specific genes:

```
list variants in BRCA1   # Check BRCA1
list variants in BRCA2   # Check BRCA2
list variants in TP53    # Check TP53
```

### Scenario 3: Identify genes affected by variants

```
list genes with variants              # Quick overview
SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 10   # Top 10 largest affected genes
```

### Scenario 4: Focus on coding changes

```
filter type=CDS                       # Show only coding sequences
SELECT VARIANTS IN VIEW               # List variants in current view
```

### Scenario 5: Prepare a figure

```
navigate chr17:7668421-7687490        # Set exact coordinates
highlight chr17:7670000-7675000       # Highlight region of interest
filter type=exon                      # Clean visualization
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Use coordinates for precision

When you need exact reproducibility, use explicit coordinates:

```
navigate chr17:7668421-7687490
```

Instead of:

```
search gene TP53
```

### Chain commands mentally

Build up complex views step by step:

1. Navigate: `goto TP53`
2. Load data: (drag and drop)
3. Filter: `filter type=exon`
4. Highlight: `highlight chr17:7670000-7675000`

### Reset when confused

```
clear all
```

This removes all filters and highlights, giving you a clean slate.

### Use natural language for discovery

Type what you want in plain English:

- "show me genes"
- "what variants are in BRCA1"
- "zoom in"
- "go to chromosome 17"

GBetter will translate and show you the GQL command used.

# Tutorial 1: Getting Started

> **Audience**: First-time users and students learning genomics
> **Time**: 15-20 minutes
> **Prerequisites**: A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
> **Last updated**: Session 23 (2026-01-22)

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding the GBetter interface
- Navigating the genome (search, pan, zoom)
- Loading local and remote data files
- Using basic filters and highlights
- Customizing themes and colors

---

## Step 1: Opening GBetter

Open GBetter in your web browser. You'll see a clean interface with:

- **Header** (top): Search bar and navigation controls
- **Sidebar** (left): Track list and file loading
- **Main area** (center): Genomic visualization canvas
- **GQL Console tab** (bottom): Click to open the advanced query interface

The browser starts with a default view of chromosome 1 in the human genome.

> [!NOTE]
> Gene tracks load automatically for most assemblies. You don't need to find gene annotations yourself.

---

## Step 2: Two Ways to Query

GBetter provides two interfaces for entering commands: the **Search Bar** for quick tasks and the **GQL Console** for advanced work.

### Search Bar (Header)

The search bar in the header is perfect for quick navigation:

- Type a gene name: `TP53`
- Type coordinates: `chr17:7668421-7687490`
- Type simple commands: `zoom in`, `pan left 10kb`

The search bar uses basic pattern matching - it works offline and responds instantly. Results appear inline next to the search bar.

> [!TIP]
> Press `/` on your keyboard to quickly focus the search bar.

### GQL Console (Bottom Panel)

For more complex queries, use the GQL Console:

1. Click the **GQL Console** tab at the bottom of the screen (or press `Cmd+`` / `Ctrl+``)
2. The console panel slides up, showing:
   - **Natural Language input** (top-left): Type questions in plain English
   - **GQL input** (bottom-left): View and edit the generated query
   - **Results panel** (center): Clickable list of results
   - **History/Saved** (right): Session history and saved queries

**When to use the Console:**

- Complex queries: `SELECT GENES INTERSECT variants ORDER BY length DESC`
- AI-powered natural language: "show me genes with high-impact variants" (requires [AI setup](../AI-SETUP.md))
- Saving queries for reproducibility
- Sharing queries via URL
- Exporting query collections

**Key difference:** The Search Bar is quick and local. The GQL Console is powerful and can use AI for natural language understanding.

For this tutorial, we'll use the Search Bar. You can try the GQL Console later - see [Tutorial 5: Reproducible Analysis](05-reproducible-analysis.md) for advanced usage.

## Step 3: Searching for a Gene

Let's find TP53, a famous tumor suppressor gene often mutated in cancer.

### Using the search bar

1. Click the search bar at the top (or press `/` on your keyboard)
2. Type: `TP53`
3. Press Enter

GBetter navigates to chromosome 17 where TP53 is located. You should see the coordinate display change to something like `chr17:7,668,421-7,687,490`.

### What just happened?

When you typed `TP53`, GBetter:

1. Recognized it as a gene name
2. Looked up its coordinates (chr17:7668421-7687490)
3. Navigated the view to show that region

---

## Step 4: Zooming In and Out

### Using buttons

- Click the **+** button to zoom in (see more detail)
- Click the **-** button to zoom out (see more context)

### Using your mouse/trackpad

- **Scroll up** to zoom in
- **Scroll down** to zoom out

> [!TIP]
> Scroll with your mouse wheel to zoom in and out quickly.

### Using commands

Type in the search bar:

```
zoom in
```

or

```
zoom out
```

### Try it!

Zoom in several times until you can see individual features (exons, CDS regions). Then zoom out to see the gene in its genomic context.

---

## Step 5: Panning

Move left or right along the chromosome.

### Using your mouse

Click and drag on the canvas to pan.

### Using commands

```
pan left 10kb
pan right 10kb
```

### Try it!

Pan around to explore the region near TP53. What other genes are nearby?

---

## Step 6: Loading a Data File

GBetter can display your own genomic data. Let's try loading a file.

### Supported formats

**Text formats** (drag and drop):

| Format | Extension | Contains |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| BED | .bed | Genomic intervals |
| GFF3 | .gff3, .gff | Gene annotations |
| VCF | .vcf | Variants |
| bedGraph | .bedgraph, .bg | Signal data |

**Binary formats** (drag and drop with index, or paste URL):

| Format | Extensions | Contains |
|--------|------------|----------|
| BigBed | .bb, .bigbed | Indexed intervals |
| BigWig | .bw, .bigwig | Indexed signal |
| BAM | .bam + .bai | Alignments |
| CRAM | .cram + .crai | Alignments (compressed) |
| Tabix | .vcf.gz + .tbi | Indexed VCF/GFF/BED |

### Loading a file

**Option A: Drag and drop**

1. Find a genomic file on your computer
2. Drag it onto the GBetter window
3. Drop it anywhere on the canvas

**Option B: Sidebar File tab**

1. Look at the **Add Tracks** section in the sidebar
2. The **File** tab is selected by default
3. Click **Drop or browse** to select files
4. For BAM/CRAM/tabix, select both the data file AND index file together

**Option C: Remote URLs**

1. Click the **URL** tab in the sidebar
2. Paste a URL to a BigBed, BigWig, or BAM file
3. Click **+** to add the track
4. The index file is auto-discovered (must be at same URL path)

> [!WARNING]
> Chromosome names must match between your files and the assembly (e.g., `chr1` vs `1`).

### What happens next?

Your data appears as a new track below the main view. Each track shows a different type of information at the same genomic position.

---

## Step 7: Using Filters

When viewing gene annotations (GFF3 files), you can filter to focus on specific feature types.

### Show only exons

```
filter type=exon
```

Exons (coding parts of genes) appear bright; everything else dims.

### Show only coding sequences

```
filter type=CDS
```

### Show features on a specific strand

```
filter strand=+
```

Shows features on the plus (forward) strand.

### Clear filters

```
clear filters
```

Returns to showing all features normally.

---

## Step 8: Highlighting Regions

Mark regions of interest with highlights.

### Highlight a region

```
highlight chr17:7670000-7675000
```

A colored overlay appears over that region.

### Clear highlights

```
clear highlights
```

---

## Step 9: Customizing Appearance

GBetter offers multiple themes and color palettes.

### Opening Settings

Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the header.

### Changing theme

In the **Display** tab:
- **Light** (default) - Clean, print-ready
- **Dark** - Easier on eyes in low light
- **High-Contrast** - Maximum readability

### Changing color palette

Choose from colorblind-safe palettes:
- **Set2** (default) - Soft, distinct colors
- **Dark2** - Bolder colors
- **Paired** - High contrast pairs

Changes apply immediately and persist across sessions.

## Try It Yourself

Load a remote BAM file to see alignments:

1. Select assembly **E. coli K-12 MG1655** from the assembly dropdown
2. Click the **URL** tab in the sidebar
3. Paste this URL:
   ```
   https://pub-cdedc141a021461d9db8432b0ec926d7.r2.dev/test/ecoli-test.bam
   ```
4. Click **+** to add the track
5. Navigate to `NC_000913.3:100000-100500`
6. Zoom in to see individual reads

You've just loaded remote alignment data without downloading anything!

## Common Questions

<details>
<summary>Why can't I find my gene?</summary>

GBetter has a built-in index of common genes. If your gene isn't found:
- Check the spelling
- Try the official gene symbol (BRCA1, not "breast cancer gene")
- Load a GFF3 file containing your gene annotations

</details>

<details>
<summary>My file won't load!</summary>

Check that:
- The file has the correct extension (.bed, .gff3, .vcf, .bedgraph)
- The file isn't too large (stay under 100MB for best performance)
- The chromosome names match (chr1 vs 1)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Everything disappeared!</summary>

You might have zoomed out too far. Try:
- Searching for a gene to navigate back
- Type `navigate chr1:1-1000000` for a default view

</details>

<details>
<summary>The tracks overlap!</summary>

Each track needs space. Try:
- Closing tracks you don't need
- Zooming out for a wider view

</details>
